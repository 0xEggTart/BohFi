**Dig this scene, man...**

Like, picture it: you're holding some bread, but the fuzz is always watching, you dig? Every move you make, the squares got their eyeballs on your stash. It's a real drag.

So we built this **far-out sanctuary** - BohFi. You tuck your tokens away in this cool, dark digital pad where nobody's peeping. Just you and your stash, doing the privacy hustle for thirty days of pure, unobserved bliss.

But here's the real mind-blower, daddy-o: better not be too laid back Jack. Cause when the timer hits zero, the vault doesn't just give you your loot back. That would be too square.

**It goes cosmic.**

20% of your stash... *poof*... goes up in smoke. Forever. A sacrificial burn to the crypto gods. Real avant-garde stuff.

The other 80%? It flows into this groovy **gas pool** that fuels the whole scene. It becomes the juice that lets every cat and kitten trade without worrying about gas, man. Without paying the man his vig.

Your private hoard becomes **public energy**. Your solitude becomes someone else's freedom. It's like, the most beautiful circle, you dig?

We're not just building another exchange pad. We're building a **karma economy**. Where privacy isn't about hiding forever - it's about temporary retreat that fuels permanent liberation.

The vault closes, the gas flows, the people trade free and easy. It's a revolution, baby. And it's all powered by the beautiful, burning release of what you once held tight.

So like, be cool. Be private. Then let it go and watch the whole scene bloom.

**That's the vibration we're laying down.** Can you dig it?
